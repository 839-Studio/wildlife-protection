# Wildlife Protection in China

##### Data behind The Paper's story, "This law-protected national wildlife list hasn't been updated for almost 30 years."

We compared the data from the List of Wild Animals under State Priority Conservation （《国家野生动物保护名录》）, and the Red List of China's Vertebrates (《中国脊椎动物红色名录》) to see **what kind of rare wild animals are missing from the government's list.** The original lists can only be found in the format of pdf, and now we have organized the data into csv file.

If you have any questions, please contact zoumy@thepaper.cn. Enjoy! :)
